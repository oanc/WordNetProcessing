Differentially expressed genes will be defined herein as gene data determined to be statistical outliers from some standard state, and which can not be ascribed to chance or natural variabilty.
This is the approach taken in [ 24 25 ] , and it has lately been extended to modeling the joint distribution of the longitudinal and time-to-event data (ie, time to withdrawal) [ 26 27 ] . In this setting, we would compare the treatment groups with two aspects simultaneously: (a) the chance (or duration) of complying with the prescribed protocol and, (b) the outcome measure (eg, mean change in systolic blood pressure) given the pattern of compliance.
First, it should provide an estimate of the confidence that the gene-expression pattern observed would occur by chance, that is, a p -value.

4%), while the 80% in (c) is an estimate of the chance of effective control of BP without side effects with the study therapies at Month 6, under an assumption of 'no information available for the missing data'.
Single nucleotide discrimination is achieved at the ligation step by the use of the thermostable DNA ligase, Ampligase, which has a high affinity for a perfectly matched substrate at the 3' end of a DNA molecule [ 17 ] . We were able to enhance allele discrimination at the ligation step by designing the OCP such that the 5' complementary region is firmly hybridized to the target sequence whereas the 3' region is in equilibrium with its target at the ligation temperature [ 12 ] . This would result in increased specificity since the correctly matched OCP will have a greater chance to act as substrate for the ligase.
The agreement between the Framingham estimates and physicians' estimates were only moderately better than chance for 5 of the 6 physicians.
Consequently, there is a good chance that this sequence contributes significantly to whatever role region 16 plays in enhancer function.

Previous authors have noted that there is an assumption by the public and the medical profession that the "end of life" is discernible [ 1 ] . Results from the SUPPORT study, however, suggest that our ability to detect the end of life is limited: the median predicted chance for two-month survival was no better than '50-50' just one week before death.
From the field, the CIA's Gary Schroen advised:"Hit him tonight-we may not get another chance."

The number of differentially regulated genes identified by these criteria, 49 with increased and 21 with decreased expression, is significantly higher than expected by random chance, but it is much lower than one would expect if MeCP2 had a crucial role as transcriptional repressor of all genes with methylated promoters.
If we use P < 0.01 to define a significant difference, we should expect ~46 chance differences (0.
However, control limits of ± 2S will be exceeded 5% of the time by chance alone, regardless of how well a laboratory performs.
The peak of nine-nucleotide TSDs, the minimum TSD length allowed by TSDfinder, is likely to be enriched in false positives because they have a relatively low average TSD score of 98; there is obviously a higher likelihood of finding these shorter matches by chance.

Mutations in MYOC have been shown to be causative for primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) [ 1 2 3 ] . Glucocorticoids have been implicated in ocular hypertension and glaucoma due to increased plasma cortisol levels [ 4 5 ] and altered cortisol metabolism [ 6 7 ] in POAG patients and from the increased risk of developing POAG in steroid-responsive patients [ 8 9 ] . Myocilin has been shown to be upregulated in glucocorticoid-treated human trabecular meshwork (TM) cells [ 10 11 ] , and there is variable evidence for increased MYOC expression in glaucomatous individuals [ 12 13 14 ] .

In determining whether or not a reference toxicant test result falls "well" outside the expected range, the result also may be compared with upper and lower bounds for ±3S, as any result outside these control limits would be expected to occur by chance only 1 out of 100 tests (Environment Canada, 1990).
Thus, if distantly related species fit the response curves predicted by the model, we can conclude either that forces at the nucleotide level drive codon and amino-acid usage, and there is nothing special about certain codons or amino acids, or that there is a unique spectrum of preferred codon and amino-acid usages that applies to all species, extends over a huge range of compositions, and happens to match the predictions of the model by chance.
Finally, the log-odds of occurrence of a specific residue is obtained from the logarithm of the sum of real and pseudo-counts divided by the background frequency that would occur in a random sequence by chance.

Since this might have everything to do what the participants' chance to socialize with friends in a nonthreatening environment and nothing to do with self-esteem or work habits, it seemed to these researchers that it was therefore logical not to decide on the evaluation questions until their appropriateness could be determined.
This modification was made to keep the data presented consistent with data presented in the other graphical formats since survival was not presented in the other graphs (the chance of not developing a disease is the closest equivalent to survival, which is the <b>chance</b> of not dying).
The association we observed with chlamydia is probably a marker of sexual behavior rather than a causal factor; for example, women who reported a history of chlamydia were more likely to douche and to report engaging in oral sex, although it is possible that chlamydia carriage adversely affects the vaginal flora increasing the chance of Candida colonization.

If we treat gene duplication as a stochastic process, the chance of a given gene being duplicated is proportional to its occurrence in the genome.
An alternative is to replace the list of the total set of genes on the microarray with a list of the total set of genes in the genome (or a representative sample), but that approach introduces another source of bias: genes not on the microarray are counted in determining N and n but have no chance to be flagged.
