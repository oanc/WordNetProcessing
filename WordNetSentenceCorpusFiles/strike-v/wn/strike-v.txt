Most critics like this "surprisingly genial and affecting comedy about the trials and tribulations of teenage rebellion during the Reagan '80s" (Jami Bernard, Daily News ).

As a speaker of AE sojourning for several months each year in Britain during the past twenty years, I have been struck by the creeping changes I have perceived in the RP pronunciation of some ordinary words (controversy, disciplinary) and of proper names: news-readers on BBC Radio 4 and World Service tend to stress Afghanistan and Khomeini on the last syllable where formerly one heard it stressed on the sound.
