However, other reports have described nalbuphine as a &quot;mixed agonist/antagonist&quot; with agonism at ? opioid receptors and antagonism at ? opioid receptors based on in vivo data [ 11 33 ] . This categorization is likely due to the fact that nalbuphine has been shown to reduce the ventilatory depressant effect of other opioids, while adding to their analgesic effect [ 33 ] . Nalbuphine is also used clinically to reduce the opioid-mediated side effects such as itching, without completely reversing the analgesic effects of the full agonists [ 34 35 36 ] . According to our data, although nalbuphine is clearly a potent agonist at ? receptors, its levels of agonism is significantly lower than the very efficacious drug fentanyl and the endogenous ligand ?-endorphin." />
