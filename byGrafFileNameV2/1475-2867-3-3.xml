Thus, different forms of vitamin E can have different antioxidant properties as well as differences in their absorption, distribution, and metabolism [ 4 ] . There are also reports that some forms of vitamin E have activity against cancer cells in vitro [ 3 5 ] . For example, tocotrienol and vitamin E succinate are reported to have antiproliferative activity in human cancer cells whereas some forms of vitamin E are reported to induce apoptosis in cancer cell types but not in normal cell types [ 3 ] . Specifically, these apoptogenic forms include RRR-?-tocopheryl succinate and RRR-?-tocopherol while the ?, ?, and ? tocopherol and acetate derivatives of tocopherol were not apoptogenic [ 3 ] . There are few reports on the use of vitamin E for treating tumorous cancers in vivo but the results are inconsistent [ 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ] . It is therefore essential that the form of vitamin E used in any research study as well as the dosage and the mode of administration be defined." />

The results demonstrated that sE supplementation did markedly suppress DOX-induced lipid peroxidation, yet tumor growth was still suppressed in mice treated with DOX and sE." />
