Persons infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) are particularly susceptible to tuberculosis, either by the reactivation of latent infection or by a primary infection with &lt;b&gt;rapid&lt;/b&gt; progression to active disease [ 1 2 3 4 ] . The annual incidence rate of tuberculosis in Colombia during 1998 was 19." />

In addition, disseminated infections with Mycobacterium avium complex are increasingly common in advanced human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease and cause substantial morbidity [ 15 16 ] . Persons with HIV infection and CD4 lymphocyte counts less than 100 cells/mm 3have a probability of 10% to 20% per year of developing M. avium complex disease or bacteremia [ 17 18 ] . Bacteremia involving M. avium complex produces a wide array of clinical signs and symptoms, including wasting, fever, and night sweats, and is associated with decreased survival [ 17 18 19 20 ] . The recovery of mycobacteria in blood cultures can help to discover bacteremia that frequently goes unrecognized." />
