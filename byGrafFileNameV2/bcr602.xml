About 40% of breast cancers are ER-negative [ 28 ] . ER-negative tumors are unresponsive to anti-estrogen therapy, probably because of constitutive growth factor expression [ 28 29 ] . In general, these tumors have a higher histologic grade and a higher proliferative rate and are associated with poorer prognosis [ 28 ] . The finding that 100% of ER-negative tumors expressed BP1 might therefore be highly relevant to both the prognosis and therapy of those difficult-to-treat tumors." />

When overexpressed in a leukemia cell line (K562), BP1 increased the ability of cells to grow in soft agar, an indicator of leukemogenic potential, up to 45-fold [ 11 ] . Consistent with a possible oncogenic role for BP1 in breast cancer was the observation that its expression was correlated with the ability of breast cancer cell lines to cause mammary tumors in mice." />
