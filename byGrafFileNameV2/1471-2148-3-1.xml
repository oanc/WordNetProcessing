Yeast proteins that have a large number of interacting partners were found to have evolved slower, on average, than those with fewer interacting partners, and this was presumed to be due to the fact that proteins with more interacting partners have a greater fraction of residues directly involved in function." />

Scale-free networks are highly tolerant to error (elimination of nodes at random) but are vulnerable to attack, i.e. elimination of the hubs [ 15 ] and, indeed, it has been found that the most highly connected proteins in yeast interaction networks tend to be essential [ 13 ] . This might explain the present findings, namely that a small number of yeast protein-protein interaction hubs evolve slowly due to strong purifying selection, whereas, for the great majority of the proteins, there is no discernible connection between the number of interactions and evolutionary rates." />
