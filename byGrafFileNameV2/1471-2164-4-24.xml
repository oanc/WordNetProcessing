Bth / Bth mice display altered potassium currents in early postnatal cochlear hair cells, in particular Ik,n and Ik,f currents appear to be depressed [ 10 ] . This observation led to the hypothesis that Tmc1 may participate directly or indirectly in regulating the permeability of potassium channels [ 10 ] . Because of the high level of conservation of the amino acid sequences among the eight mammalian TMC proteins (Figure 1, Additional file 1), we speculate that other TMC proteins may as well be modifiers of ion channels or transporters." />
