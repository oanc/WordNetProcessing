One of the major metabolites, N-desmethylclozapine has been shown to have pharmacological activity both in vitro [ 28 ] and in vivo in rats [ 29 ] . In addition, N-desmethylclozapine is found in large concentrations in the serum of schizophrenic patients [ 5 15 ] and in rats [ 30 ] . The contribution of N-desmethylclozapine to clozapine's central effects has been questioned recently, since the levels of N-desmethylclozapine in the brain were much lower than those of clozapine [ 30 ] suggesting that N-desmethylclozapine does not cross the blood-brain barrier as readily as clozapine." />

However, a systemic dose of prazosin (alpha1 antagonist) did not inhibit the EUS EMG activity during high frequency oscillations in the rat [ 27 ] . Thus, although alpha1 antagonism has been shown to modulate pudendal reflexes in the cat, their role in modulating the activity of the EUS during micturition in the rat appears unclear." />
