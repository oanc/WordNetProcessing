In this study, we &lt;b&gt;show&lt;/b&gt; that rDEK can bind to the DQA1 Y box, and that DEK in nuclear extracts participates in the DQA1 Y-box binding complex in vitro . Thus, we propose a model in which intracellular signaling modulates the ability of DEK to bind DNA, causing alteration of MHC class II transcription." />

Two recent studies have shown a highly significant association between early-onset pauciarticular JRA and circulating antibodies to the 43-kDa nuclear protein DEK [ 8 9 ] . Although circulating DEK antibodies have subsequently been found in children and adults with other autoimmune diseases [ 10 11 ] , these two studies did reveal that children with JRA are significantly more likely to have anti-DEK antibodies than are children without rheumatic disease." />
