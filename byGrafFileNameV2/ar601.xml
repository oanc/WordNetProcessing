IL-10 can affect both the viability and the production of immunoglobulin by B cells [ 32 33 ] . To determine whether the augmentation in CIA correlated with an alteration in anticollagen antibodies, we collected sera from animals at the time of sacrifice." />

The release of reactive oxygen and nitrogen intermediates by macrophages is also suppressed by IL-10 [ 13 14 ] . In addition, IL-10 stimulates the production of cytokine inhibitors such as IL-1 receptor antagonist [ 15 ] . In patients with rheumatoid arthritis, IL-10 is produced by synovial membrane cells and is found at high levels in the synovial fluid [ 16 17 ] . It has been shown that suppression of IL-10 production by synovial cells is associated with increased levels of IL-1 and TNF-?, suggesting that IL-10 plays a suppressive role in rheumatoid arthritis joints [ 16 ] . It was also observed that IL-10 directly stimulated proteoglycan synthesis and reversed the cartilage degradation induced by activated mononuclear cells [ 18 ] . These immunosuppressive activities indicate that IL-10 is a potential therapeutic approach for autoimmune diseases." />

The present data are consistent with previous results and show that a complete absence of IL-10 exacerbates inflammation in CIA [ 37 38 39 ] . The anti-inflammatory properties of IL-10 suggest that endogenous IL-10 may function as a regulator of proinflammatory mediators in vivo [ 39 ] . It is interesting, however, that disease severity inversely correlates with the levels of IFN-? in IL-10 -/-mice, suggesting that IL-10 may control disease activity via regulating IFN-? responses." />
