This leads to the switching of the RdRP to the &quot;replication mode&quot;, resulting in the synthesis of full-length, encapsidated anti-genomic RNA, which is in turn replicated into more genomic RNA [ 15 ] . Thus, the very requirement of N for replication ensures that all full-length genomic and antigenomic RNA are wrapped with N protein, i.e., encapsidated [ 15 ] . The new pool of replicated genomic RNA serves as templates for secondary transcription." />

While the resistance of the viral genomic RNA to dsRNA has important ramifications for antiviral therapy, it is also clear that the dsRNA approach cannot be used against cis -acting NNR viral genomic sequences such as the intergenic regions, for which the cDNA-based approach will continue to be the method of choice [ 16 ] .
