Applying fold change thresholds has been the most common method of reducing noise by filtering out the false positives [ 8 9 13 ] . However, much of the work done to date has focused on decreasing noise within the same generation and has not addressed the issue of comparability across generations." />

Microarrays are sensitive to noise from many sources including the manufacturing process and the experimental (RNA isolation, labeling, hybridization, staining, washing and scanning) processes." />

The fragmented cRNA together with control targets recommended by Affymetrix were hybridized to the GeneChip of choice (HuGeneFL or HG-U95A)." />
