Electrosurgical devices and radiofrequency ablation probes both operate within the same frequency range and &lt;b&gt;transfer&lt;/b&gt; energy in similar ways, but differ in the shape of stimulation waveforms." />

Perhaps the greatest reason for assuming constant electrical properties is the enormous computational advantage of being able to separate the electromagnetic and heat transfer problems." />
