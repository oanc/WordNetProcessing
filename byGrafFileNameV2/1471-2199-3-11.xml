Similarly, transfer of a wild type PTEN gene into anchorage-independent human glioblastoma cells (which lack functional PTEN), results in their greatly reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar [ 4 5 6 ] . The interpretation of these latter findings, however, is complicated by the strong anti-proliferative effects of PTEN even in monolayer culture, which is consistently observed when the wild type version of this gene is introduced into PTEN-negative tumor cells [ 4 6 7 8 9 10 18 33 ] . Moreover, in human glioma and breast cancer cell lines, the ectopic expression of wild type PTEN leads to anoikis, which is apoptosis initiated by the disruption of cell matrix-interactions [ 23 34 35 36 ] ." />

Furthermore, expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 Kip1was strongly increased in suspension cells (Figure 1), similar to what has been observed in other cell types after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions [ 29 31 32 ] .

Furthermore, p27 Kip1is an established target of PTEN signaling, i.e., its activity has been found increased after the forced expression of exogenous PTEN [ 53 54 55 56 ] . In combination with the data presented in this manuscript, it therefore appears that PTEN contributes to anchorage-dependent growth control by a two-fold approach: the dephosphorylation of the signaling molecule FAK in combination with the stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1." />

Second, its lipid phosphatase activity targets the second messenger phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PtdIns(3,4,5)P 3 ] and thereby blocks activation of the protein kinase B (PKB/Akt) pathway [ 11 18 22 23 24 ] . Whereas both of the above pathways are intimately involved in the control of cell growth and survival, PTEN-regulated FAK activity further appears to impinge on cell adhesion, cell migration, and cell invasion [ 20 21 ] . It therefore emerges that the loss of PTEN activity may confer increased survival ability, proliferative potential, and invasive capacity on cells, and thereby may promote progression towards a more malignant phenotype." />
