A potential problem with the use of rapamycin and its analogs is that some tumors are intrinsically resistant to its effects [ 33 34 ] . Resistance in mammalian cells has been associated with decreased expression of 4EBP-1 [ 35 ] , mutations in the ATM protein [ 36 ] , and low level expression of p27 Kip1due to enhanced turnover of the protein [ 37 ] . In addition, it has been demonstrated that fibroblasts from p27 Kip1knockout mice are more resistant to the effects of rapamycin than normal cells [ 37 ] . Thus p27 Kip1is an important mediator of cell growth inhibition in response to rapamycin." />

Nuclear eIF4E appears to be involved in export of cyclin D1 mRNA to the cytosol [ 25 ] . Both 4E-T and PML interact with the same domain of eIF4E that binds 4EBP [ 32 ] .
