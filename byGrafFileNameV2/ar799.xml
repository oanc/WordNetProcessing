We have also reported that a 31 kDa amino-terminal ?-actinin fragment, which we have named mactinin, is generated by the degradation of extracellular ?-actinin by monocyte-secreted urokinase [ 6 ] . Furthermore, we have demonstrated that mactinin is present in inflammation caused by Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, by examining bronchoalveolar lavage fluid from mice with infection [ 6 ] . It was not present in mice not challenged with P. carinii , suggesting that inflammaton is necessary for mactinin formation." />
