Furthermore, PI4K activity has been shown to associate with the actin cytoskeleton by biochemical detergent extraction [ 28 ] and is thought to specifically localize with ?3?1 integrin [ 29 ] . PI4K catalyzes the production of phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate, an intermediate in multiple phosphatidylinositol signaling pathways which itself can interact with actin binding proteins to regulate microfilament polymerization [ 30 ] . Our work now suggests that the mRNAs of these proteins are all positioned in close association with the actin cytoskeleton to permit efficient localization of their protein products." />
