This communication represents our initial efforts to use DNA microarrays in a reductionist approach to begin to identify the genes expressed as a consequence of triggering each individual ligand during lymphocyte activation." />

The signal intensity of a particular transcript detected on an oligonucleotide array would thus be directly related to this abundance level." />
