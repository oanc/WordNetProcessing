The life expectancies for persons diagnosed with cirrhosis are significantly reduced [ 8 9 10 11 ] compared with age and sex-matched controls, with the exception of certain pathological subtypes [ 12 ] . The likelihood of variceal bleeding is reported to be greatest within the first two years of diagnosis [ 13 ] . Owing to the high mortality risk associated with variceal hemorrhage, primary prophylaxis against a first bleed becomes an important therapeutic intervention [ 9 ] . There are several other therapies that are clinically useful for patients with established cirrhosis [ 14 15 ] , as well as therapies for specific causes of liver disease, such as viral hepatitis [ 16 ] ." />
