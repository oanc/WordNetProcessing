The importance of the ligand was demonstrated by substitution of His with the weaker Lewis base Asn in the apoprotein of the bacterial light-harvesting complex LH1, which eliminated assembly of the complex in vivo and reconstitution in vitro [ 30 ] . Formation of a stable coordination bond with a weaker Lewis base is expected to require a stronger Lewis acid." />

These two LHCP sub-species, along with Lhca4 are most affected by the lack of Chl b in vivo [ 5 ] . Lhcb4 (apoprotein of CP29) has Val instead of Pro at 'position 82', and the absence of site a 6 in Lhcb4 may contribute to its drastic reduction in Chl b -less mutants [ 5 8 ] . However, Lhcb2, Lhcb3, Lhca1, Lhca2 and Lhca3 contain the Gly peptide carbonyl as a ligand (each has Pro at 'position 82' [ 40 ] ) but are reduced only slightly, if any, in amount by the lack of Chl b." />
