Mutations in the LMNA gene associated with DCM have a more severe prognosis and higher-event rates compared to individuals with DCM that do not have LMNA mutations [ 20 ] . A recent report describing another family with a LMNA mutation causing DCM and conduction system disease documents the need for permanent pacemaker implantation [ 21 ] . Previous reports on the proband's kindred support a high-event rate in family members often resulting in sudden cardiac death even in family members with permanent pacemakers [ 10 ] . For example, ten out of 38 family members with pacemakers for high-grade atrioventricular block died suddenly." />
