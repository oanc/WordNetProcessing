Although a study of British adults found elevated levels of serum homocysteine to be associated with an increased risk of stroke [ 19 ] , a case-control study of a common polymorphism (methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase [MTHFR] T677C) that results in increased serum homocysteine concentrations found no difference between patients with stroke and controls in either genotype or allele frequency [ 20 ] . Because antiplatelet agents with different mechanisms of action can bring about significant reductions in stroke risk, several platelet receptor genes have been tested as candidate stroke susceptibility genes [ 21 22 ] . To date, however, no compelling evidence for an association between any platelet receptor gene polymorphism and risk of stroke has been found." />
