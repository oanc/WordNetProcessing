This hypothesis deserved consideration in this study, as the site of duplication of the CHRNA7 locus in the human genome may correspond to the pericentric inversion breakpoint, and the high sequence homology noted between the donor and duplicated CHRNA7 loci does not establish the human-specificity of the CHRNA7 duplication, as gene conversion may also maintain high sequence homology of duplicated segments [ 26 27 ] . Thus, we tested the chimpanzee genome by Southern genomic analysis for the presence of the CHRNA7 duplication which revealed this duplication is most likely human-specific and therefore did not contribute to the pericentric inversion in chimpanzee (Figure 5)." />
