Most pundits point out--sometimes ominously, sometimes dismissively--that no one has seen Starr's cards: They may show &quot;Lizzie Borden in drag&quot; (Shields, PBS's NewsHour With Jim Lehrer ).

Stuart Taylor wrote as much this week in the National Journal and appears on This Week to reprise the point." />
