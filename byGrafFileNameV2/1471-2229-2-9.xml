As time-resolved data sets become available and feedback loops are delineated, it may be necessary to use these methods to understand system dynamics and control [ 30 ] . However, the authors agree with Genoud et." />

The treatment of npr1-2 seedlings with exogenous SA failed to induce increases in PR-1 gene expression under some experimental conditions [ 19 ] albeit not under all conditions [ 15 ] . The potential alternative explanation that results presented herein were caused by residual gene product function in the mutant lines used is thus not correct." />
