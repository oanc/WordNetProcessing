They explored the problem of a soul attempting to will its wishes into being, even when the body can't easily accommodate them ( Boys Don't Cry , The Sixth Sense .) Body and soul: This, it seems to me, is the problem that inspired the best moments in the best films of 1999." />

Let's start with the small gifts of this movie, the little things it attempts that so few American movies ever bother with." />
