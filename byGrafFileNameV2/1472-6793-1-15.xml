Recent evidence suggests that the four internal repeats of the voltage-gated Na +channel, which is closely related to the L-type Ca 2+channel encoded by the DHPR, have non-equivalent functional roles because the S4 segments of repeats I and II move much faster than those of repeats III and IV [ 40 ] . By analogy, the &quot;fast-moving&quot; module of the DHPR would be represented by the N-terminal fragment and the &quot;slower-moving&quot; module by the C-terminal fragment." />
