However, this region may be involved in protein interactions, based on strong protein protections observed in this region [ 14 ] . Strong protein protections are also observed in the Id4 terminal purine-rich loop." />

They have been found in organelle genomes of fungi and plants and also in a number of bacteria [ 6 ] . None have been found in animals, although it has been suggested that group II introns may be progenitors of nuclear spliceosomal introns based on similarities between nuclear pre-mRNA splicing in eukaryotes and the splicing mechanism used by group II introns [ 7 8 ] ." />

Additionally, this element is absent from the introns S.p.cox2 I1, P.a.cox1 I4, A.m.cox1 I3 and P.a.cox1 I1, along with Id(ii)1 [ 13 ] .
