In normal cells, p27 Kip1levels are high in GO and decrease rapidly in late G1 allowing entry into S-phase [ 3 4 ] . p27 Kip1has also been implicated as playing a role in tumor formation and progression." />

In addition, it was recently reported that the p27 Kip15'- UTR has an internal ribosome entry site that allows cap-independent initiation of translation [ 30 ] . However, none of these reports have utilized the full 5'- UTR that results from transcription initiation at the major start site." />
