Mechanical ventilation has been suggested to potentiate the adverse effects of underlying critical illness on splanchnic vasculature and contribute to the development of multiorgan dysfunction syndrome, particularly when 'injurious' ventilatory strategies that produce high end-inspiratory lung volumes are employed [ 3 ] . Experimental studies suggested that mechanical ventilation with considerably high levels of PEEP can lead to splanchnic hypoperfusion and marked reduction in hepatic blood flow [ 4 5 6 ] . Furthermore, PEEP may decrease splanchnic blood flow in patients with no underlying lung disease [ 7 8 ] . Most available evidence regarding the effects of PEEP from animal studies has been extrapolated to humans based on the assumption that the effects of mechanical ventilation on humans and animals are similar." />
