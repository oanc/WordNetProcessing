Further work is needed to assess the additional levels of regulatory control that may constrain the availability of the AQP1 proteins to serve as ion channels gated by cGMP, within a background of constitutive water channel activity." />

This &quot;empty&quot; AV contains the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter and bovine growth hormone polyadenylation (bHG) site separated by a polylinker that was used to clone AQP1 DNA as described previously [ 27 ] . A recombinant AQP1 virus was constructed using a plasmid containing the coding sequence for AQP1, pCHIPev [ 28 ] . pCHIPev was digested and the AQP1 insert was subcloned into the shuttle vector pSKAC, creating pSKAC/AQP1." />
