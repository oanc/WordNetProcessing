Our FISH study assigned the STSL locus rat chromosome 6q12, a region where a cluster of blood pressure QTL with Lod score 4~6 has been reported to be present (M6MIT12-M6MIT3, 39 cM distance) in a New Zealand genetically hypertensive rat (GH rat) [ 35 ] . With respect to hypertension, although the SHR and SHRSP strains carry the Gly583Cys mutation, in extensive QTL mapping studies using these strains, no loci mapping to the rat STSL region have been reported [ 35 ] . In our study, the GH rat is neither sitosterolemic, nor has any nucleotide alteration at the STSL locus that would implicate this region as mutated." />

These rats exhibit defects at two levels: increased absorption of sterols (plant and animal) at the intestinal level and decreased excretion of sterols into bile [ 16 ] . The higher sterol absorption in the intestine and the lower biliary excretion of plant sterols in these rat strains led us to hypothesise that Abcg5 or Abcg8 gene mutations may be responsible for the sitosterolemia observed in these hypertensive rats." />

The protein products of these two genes (sterolin-1 and sterolin-2 respectively) are thought to form heterodimers to constitute a functional transporter, based primarily on the genetic evidence that affected individuals are either completely mutated in sterolin-1 or sterolin-2, but not both [ 12 ] .
