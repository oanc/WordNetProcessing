In both type 1 and type 1, as well as, type 2 diabetes, the role of free radicals in diabetic complications is well studied." />

Consequently, ?-cells with high levels of DNA damage from younger individuals with a shorter duration of diabetes might be eliminated by apoptosis, while similarly damaged ?-cells from older individuals, who are likely to have had diabetes for a longer time may be resistant to apoptosis and so remain." />
