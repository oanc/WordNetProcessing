Epidermal growth factor, which binds to the same receptor as transforming growth factor-?, increases SP-A content in human fetal lung [ 24 ] . Hepatocyte growth factor has also been shown to upregulate the synthesis of SP-A in rat type II cells [ 25 ] . Thus, phosphorylation of p44/42 MAPK may be involved in the up-regulation of SP-A gene expression, results consistent with our observation that inhibition of basal levels of p44/42 MAPK phosphorylation may decrease SP-A gene expression." />

An increased incidence of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) has been observed in infants of diabetic mothers [ 1 ] . RDS is caused by inadequate amounts of pulmonary surfactant due to delayed lung development [ 2 ] . It has been proposed that high insulin levels can delay lung development in the fetus of the diabetic mother [ 3 ] ." />

PI 3-kinase gene expression [ 26 ] . Similarly, in L6 myotubes, insulin induces hexokinase II gene transcription via the rapamycin-sensitive PI 3-kinase pathway, but not via the MAPK pathway [ 27 ] . The PI 3-kinase - p70 S6 kinase pathway, but not the MAPK pathway, mediates insulin induction of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase gene expression in primary rat hepatocytes [ 28 ] . In H411E liver cells, insulin down-regulates cAMP-induced phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase gene transcription via the PI 3-kinase pathway, but not via the MAPK pathway [ 29 ] . Phosphorylated p70 S6 kinase has been shown to be present in the nucleus in insulin-treated cells [ 30 ] . Moreover, it has been shown that p70 S6 kinase phosphorylates and activates members of the cAMP response element modulator family of transcription factors [ 31 ] . These data raise the possibility that transcriptional regulation of SP-A gene expression occurs via the PI 3-kinase - p70 S6 kinase pathway." />
