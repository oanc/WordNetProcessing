This dysfunction can arise from a variety of mutations within the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene on chromosome 7, which encodes the transmembrane pump responsible for regulating transepithelial ion levels [ 1 2 4 ] . This defect is associated with an increased viscosity of the airway surface fluid, and according to some studies, an altered salt concentration [ 5 6 ] . These and other pleiotropic effects of the CF gene abnormality increase the susceptibility of CF patients to bronchopulmonary bacterial infection by opportunistic pathogens." />

Thus, attachment of polymyxin B to Yersinia enterocolitica is reduced by steric hindrance generated by the size and/or branched shape of the outer core region of its LPS macromolecule [ 55 ] . Additionally, resistance to cationic peptides can be due to cytoplasmic clearance of the antimicrobial peptide by an efflux pump; e.g., Yersinia resistance to polymyxin B caused by the RosA/RosB efflux pump/potassium antiporter [ 56 ] and Neisseria gonorrhoeae resistance to protegrin PG-1 via an energy-dependent efflux system termed mtr [ 57 ] ." />
