MAGUK is a new family of proteins that act as a molecular scaffold for intracellular signaling pathways [ 11 ] . The MAGUK family of proteins is characterized by domains that interact with other proteins to create an assembly of large multi-protein complexes [ 10 ] . The PDZ (PSD-95, DLG and ZO-1) domains are the best characterized for their binding to the C-terminal region of channels and transmembrane proteins [ 11 ] . Usually each protein has 1-3 copies of such domains [ 8 12 13 ] . The SH3 domain (Src homology 3) are present in proteins that couple transmembrane receptors to signaling molecules [ 14 ] . The presence of this domain in MAGUKs increases their possibilities of interacting with signaling pathways." />

Furthermore this domain has been shown to interact with other proteins [ 16 17 18 ] . MAGUKs function by binding to the transmembrane proteins at the cytoplasmic side and to other signal transduction proteins and thus appear to provide the platform for efficient and specific signal interactions between the different components of the signaling pathway." />
