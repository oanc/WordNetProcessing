Therefore the ligands for the binding sites described here occur endogenously within the RA joint, adding further evidence towards a role for these receptors in vivo . In the RA joint the synovial macrophage is among the principle cell types that produce CCL2, CCL3 and CXCL8 [ 8 17 ] . The finding of chemokine receptors on these cells suggests that macrophages may amplify inflammation by attracting cells of the same type, and other cell types, into the joint thereby setting up a positive feedback loop." />
