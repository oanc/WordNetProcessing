More importantly, the lock and key concepts used to evaluate enzyme-substrate binding, in reality, refer to flexible locks and keys that are both in constant dynamic (thermal) motion [ 15 ] . For example, an analysis of conformational changes upon complex formation for a representative set of 39 pairs of ligand-free and ligand-bound structures showed that 50% of these proteins undergo substantial main-chain and side chain conformational changes when the ligand is bound [ 15 ] ." />

The bonding stabilizes the flaps in a closed position and inhibits the activities of the enzyme." />
