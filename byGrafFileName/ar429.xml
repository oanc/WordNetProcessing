For CMV seropositive subjects, they observed that 42 (84%) subjects had antibodies to RNP, 32 (64%) had antibodies to Sm, and 23 (46%) had antibodies to U1-70 kD [ 14 ] . If Newkirk et al . used a negative/positive cutoff value of the mean plus three standard deviations then, overall, less than 10% of their sera contained autoantibodies." />

If this is the case, it predicts a correlation between levels of antibodies to gB and U1-70 kD in sera." />

This appears to have resulted in a negative/positive cutoff value significantly lower than that observed in the present study using either the manufacturer's recommended cutoff value or our own cutoff value established with the 40 seronegative sera." />
