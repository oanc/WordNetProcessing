In this paper we introduce a screen to detect the presence of pancreatic cancer by looking for somatic mutations in p53 and K- ras 2 using polony technology to microsequence mutational hotspots within these two genes." />

Pancreatic cancer, which results in the death of approximately 30,000 Americans annually and is the fourth leading cause of cancer mortalities in the United States, exhibits this hallmark [ 10 ] . For example, in pancreatic cancer there is a high incidence of mutations (&gt;50%) in the tumor suppressor genes p16, p53 and DPC4 and approximately 90% of cases coincide with a mutation in the oncogene K- ras 2 [see review by [ 11 ] ]. Furthermore, a significant percentage of tumors harboring a mutated copy of DPC4 or p53 also lose the corresponding wildtype allele, resulting in LOH [see reviews by [ 11 12 ] ]." />
