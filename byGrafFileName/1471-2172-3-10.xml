The amino acid sequences of the zinc finger pairs among the ZAS proteins are highly conserved [Reviewed in [ 25 ] ]. The conservation of the zinc fingers from invertebrate to vertebrate species and their common DNA binding target sequences suggest that these proteins may play similar physiological roles in diverse organisms." />

Enhancer or promoter elements are important for the recombination process in cell lines and animal models [ 60 ] . Similarly, expression of transcription factors, in conjunction with the recombination activating genes, has been shown to induce V(D)J recombination in non-lymphoid tissues by rendering RSS accessible to the recombinase [ 61 ] . The ?B motif, first found in the Ig? light chain [ 62 ] , and later in the TCR ?2 locus [ 31 ] , has been shown to promote V(D)J recombination by modulating locus accessibility [ 63 ] . In addition to influencing recombination by binding of RSS, KRC binding of the ?B motif may modulate accessibility and transcription of target loci." />

Furthermore, the MAST search identified KRC-selected motifs near two chromosomal breakpoints: between a t(11:14) translocation of the Ig DH2-2 gene segment and the B cell lymphoma 1 ( BCL-1 ) gene in a mantle cell lymphoma [ 36 ] , and at a t(11:19) translocation of the myeloid lymphoid leukemia ( MLL ) gene and the ENL/MLLT1/LTG19 gene in a T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia [ 37 ] . The other hits were derived from loci of cellular genes, pseduogenes, or DNA fragments [ 41 42 43 44 ] . The expression of those genes has not been shown to be regulated by KRC or other family members, therefore, the biological significance of those MAST results is unknown." />

Since a single fusion protein was used in each binding reaction, the slight variation in the gel mobility of the DNA-protein complexes may reflect that KRC has more than one target, or that the targets were located at different positions within the 25-mer DNA." />
