This suggests that an alteration to the levator ani supportive function may significantly contribute to the pathogenesis of PFD [ 3 ] , which affect 5% of younger and nearly 50% of elderly women [ 2 ] . In women, the levator muscles form a horizontal shelf with an anterior midline cleft (the urogenital hiatus) through which the urethra, vagina, and rectum pass." />
