The oocysts are resistant to environmental degradation [ 9 ] , survive chlorination water treatment, and are too small (4 to 6 microns) to be removed by conventional water filters [ 6 ] . Risk factors for acquiring cryptosporidiosis have been determined primarily in studies of community-wide outbreaks, and drinking water has been implicated as the source of these outbreaks [ 9 10 11 12 13 14 ] . Case-control studies in AIDS patients have also been conducted during outbreaks [ 12 15 ] , but levels of endemic risk in the United States remain uncertain, even though there is great concern for diarrheal disease associated with drinking water in this population [ 16 17 ] . Because defining the risk associated with drinking tap water is particularly important for counseling immunocompromised patients on reducing their risk of cryptosporidiosis, we conducted a case-control study among persons with AIDS in San Francisco to test the hypothesis that the pattern of tap water consumption is associated with the development of endemic cryptosporidiosis." />
