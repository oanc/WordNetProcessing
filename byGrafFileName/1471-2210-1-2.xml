The mechanism by which VA produces SB is unknown but inhibition of folic acid metabolism is one hypothesis [ 2 3 ] . Some investigators have brought the folic acid hypothesis into question by demonstrating that folic acid supplementation has no effect on VA exposed embryos in-vitro [ 4 5 ] . These studies suggest that another mechanism may be responsible for the production of SB by VA." />
