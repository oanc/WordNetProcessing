Patients with SSZ hepatotoxicity demonstrate a prompt recurrence of symptoms upon rechallenge with SSZ or sulfonamide [ 15 29 30 31 ] . Susceptibility to the toxic effects of SSZ and other sulfonamides may be due to the interaction of metabolic pathways regulating N-acetylation and specific detoxification of the metabolites of the drug [ 32 33 ] . However, it remains unclear if genetic differences in drug metabolizing enzyme expression may increase the risk of SSZ toxicity." />
