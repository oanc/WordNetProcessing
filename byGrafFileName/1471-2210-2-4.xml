However, since this molecule is such a poor substrate with ALDH1 compared to ALDH3, the measured activity likely represents only ALDH3 activity." />

In a second study, ALDH1A1 protein was detected using an ELISA assay and activity was detected using aldophosphamide as substrate [ 31 ] . In these two studies, designed to look at the relationship of ALDH1A1 activity to antitumor drug resistance, the levels of ALDH1A1 were low in HL-60 compared to other cell types, corresponding to the sensitivity of HL-60 cells to oxazaphosphorines." />
