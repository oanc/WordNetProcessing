Several insect-selective toxins have been identified and purified from scorpions collected in different geographical locations [ 2 11 15 16 17 18 ] . However, the Indian red scorpion, Mesobuthus tamulus, known for its severe toxicity [ 19 20 ] received little attention in this regard." />

In the quest for natural insect-selective toxins, we have identified a novel short lepidopteran-selective toxin from the venom of Mesobuthus tamulus having 37 amino acids residues and 8 half-cystines." />

Although the information available on the mode of action of these toxins is limited, it appears that different short toxins exhibit considerable diversity in their physiological mechanisms in spite of their structural homology." />
