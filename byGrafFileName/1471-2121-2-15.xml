Although we have not examined the ultrastructure of the dermal fibroblasts at the edge of wound sites, we showed previously by electron microscopy that in the lens of SPARC-null mice numerous cellular processes extended into the ECM of the lens capsule [ 23 ] . We further showed that, in contrast to the abnormal filopodial projections at the lens cell-ECM interface, cell-cell contacts between the neighboring lens epithelial cells and between the lens epithelial and fiber cells were normal [ 23 ] . The results indicate that disassembly of cell-cell contacts between lens cells is not taking place, despite the forward movement of the lens cells into the ECM of the capsule." />
