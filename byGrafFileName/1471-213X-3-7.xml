This has been corroborated by the observation that in Sitobioum graminum the majority of embryos also pass winter at the end of anatrepsis [ 13 ] , and the same may be true of Aphis pomi in Virginia USA [ 14 ] . Other aphids, however, including German clones of Aphis pomi, appear to develop constantly throughout the winter, with no definite resting stage [ 15 ] . A resting stage is a widely reported characteristic of diapause [ 1 2 16 17 18 ] and so the extent to which diapause occurs generally in aphids is therefore in some doubt." />
