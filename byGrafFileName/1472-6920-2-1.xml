Using GT can also overcome some problems inherent in inter-rater reliability, such as overestimating reliability [ 41 ] . Due to the large number of preceptors involved in our OSCE, we made the statistically reasonable assumption that any error due to rater differences is randomly distributed." />

This analysis accounts statistically for rater error by parsing out the variance relevant to the instrument in question." />
