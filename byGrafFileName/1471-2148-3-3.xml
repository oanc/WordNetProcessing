The condition that the fraction of neutral mutants ?/( L ?- L ) is much larger than the total fraction of viable mutants among all possible sequences is crucial for the exponential decay of w ( d ). Consider by contrast the Russian Roulette model by Gavrilets and Gravner [ 40 ] , in which all sequences are randomly assigned a fitness value of either 0 or 1. The total fraction p of viable sequences in this model is equal to the expected fraction of neutral mutants of any sequence with fitness 1, and w ( d ) Å p for d &gt; 0 in this model." />
