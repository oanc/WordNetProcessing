Dicer action serves to inhibit viral infection and retroposon movement, and also plays a role in developmental pathways by cleaving precursors to small regulatory RNAs (reviewed in [ 14 15 ] ). The predicted sequence of the mouse Dicer polypeptide exhibits a single dsRBM and tandem catalytic domains." />
