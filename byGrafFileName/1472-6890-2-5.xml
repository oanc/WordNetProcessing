Although there is data to suggest that CD7-negative T-cells may represent a distinct differentiation pathway in normal and neoplastic helper T cells, [ 20 21 ] the variable expression of CD7 in MF/SS that we have observed suggests that this marker may be highly modulated by tumor microenvironment and/or treatment." />
