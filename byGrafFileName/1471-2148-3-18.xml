Saltikov and Olson [ 28 ] used probes/primers based on the E. coli ars operon to detect ars genes in natural environments, and presented a phylogenetic analysis of these genes, however their analysis was largely confined to enteric bacteria (those that were similar enough to E. coli to be detected) and they emphasized the arsB gene rather than arsC . As part of a review of microbial arsenic transformations, we recently determined a preliminary arsC phylogeny based on 19 sequences [ 29 ] .
