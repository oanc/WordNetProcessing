Laboratory rats of some strains can be manipulated to unmask responses to photoperiod or melatonin, even though short photoperiod alone does not affect reproduction [ 7 8 9 ] . Peripubertal rats in the inbred Fischer 344 (F344) and Brown Norway (BN) strains are naturally sensitive to reproductive inhibition by short photoperiod alone [ 4 5 6 ] . In several species of rodents, peripubertal young have stronger reproductive responses to photoperiod than adults [ 10 11 12 13 ] , and this appears to be true for induced-photoresponsive laboratory rats as well [ 14 ] ." />
