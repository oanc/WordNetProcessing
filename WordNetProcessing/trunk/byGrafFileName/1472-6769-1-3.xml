His96, which is responsible for covalent catalysis and more than 4? 10 6-fold of rate enhancement in ApppA hydrolysis [ 9 11 12 13 ] , is nonetheless dispensable for ApppA-binding and tumor suppression, suggesting that Fhit function in tumor suppression depends on formation of an E-S complex [ 2 12 ] . If Fhit-substrate complexes promote tumor suppression by stimulating a pro-apoptotic effector, then Fhit inhibitors that resemble natural substrates may promote Fhit function." />
