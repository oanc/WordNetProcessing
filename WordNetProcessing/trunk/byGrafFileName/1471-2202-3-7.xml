The antigen-antibody complexes were visualized with ECL chemiluminescence (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, NJ)." />

Since these &quot;hotspots&quot; could become a limiting factor in the number of unique insertions recovered within a target sequence, the second reading frame through the Tn 5 MEs was used for the ECFP transposon." />

Little is known about the mechanism whereby changes in channel conformation are converted to changes in the fluorophore, so it remains to be determined whether GFP can signal conformational changes in other kinds of proteins." />

Creating efficent donor and acceptor fusion proteins is difficult, however, because FRET only occurs when the two fluorophores are attached to surfaces that are very close to one another." />

A surprisingly large number of the resulting fusion proteins were fluorescent and retained cAMP binding, demonstrating that this can be a powerful approach." />
