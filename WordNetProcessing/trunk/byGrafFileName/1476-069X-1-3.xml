In a study conducted during the Gulf War, Richards and his colleagues concluded that upper respiratory symptoms were more frequent in troops housed in air-conditioned barracks when compared to those that were housed in non-air-conditioned barracks, open warehouses or tents [ 3 ] . In a hospital-based study, an outbreak of varicella virus was explained by airflow studies, which demonstrated the spread of airborne virus from an infected patient housed in an isolation room to 15 other patients [ 1 ] . In a study conducted during a pneumococcal disease epidemic in a crowded jail, it was &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; that attack rates were 95% higher in cells with the lowest volume of air supply per person [ 4 ] ." />
