(Asteraceae), as broadly conceived by Linnaeus, is the largest genus in Tribe Anthemideae [ 1 2 3 ] and one of the largest in the family [ 4 ] .

Because of the abundance of wind-dispersed Artemisia pollen in the geological column, it is used as an indicator of steppe climates [ 14 ] . Some members are foraged by ungulates, rodents, birds, and insects [ 11 15 16 17 18 19 ] , despite the production of sesquiterpenes that afford a bitter taste to the herbage." />
