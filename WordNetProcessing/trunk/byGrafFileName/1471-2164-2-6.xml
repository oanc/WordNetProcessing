This is likely to be true for humans also, considering the extremely high incidence (4-5%) of infertility in men [ 2 ] .

BOULE is expressed later, in the cytoplasm of pachytene spermatocytes [ 5 ] . Genetic and biochemical studies suggest a role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation." />

A role for the DAZ family in the regulation of mRNA translation is supported by lines of circumstantial evidence, including the association of DAZL with polyribosomes [ 12 ] . The absence of DAZAP1 from polyribosomes indicates that it is not directly involved in protein synthesis." />
