Further, both aspirin [ 20 21 22 ] and other NSAIDs [ 19 ] have been shown to inhibit pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro . Recent studies have also reported an association between oncogenic ras and COX-2 expression [ 23 24 ] . Since pancreatic tumors tend to exhibit a high frequency of K- ras mutations [ 25 ] , the relationship between the K- ras oncogene and COX-2 should be explored further in vivo." />
