Activated glucocorticoid receptors have been shown to repress NF-?B-mediated gene expression [ 31 ] , and to cause a significant reduction in nuclear levels of p65 protein, a subunit of NF-?B [ 31 ] . A variety of mitogens, cytokines, and reactive oxygen intermediates have been shown to rapidly cause the translocation of NF-?B to the nucleus [ 30 31 32 ] , and the ability of dexamethasone to interfere with this translocation is blocked by prior treatment with the glucocorticoid antagonist RU 486 [ 30 ] . Based on these findings, it is plausible to speculate that exposure to RU 486 may interfere with the function of endogenous glucocorticoids as regulators of cell cycle, allowing the initiation and progression of malignant transformation of liver cells." />

This protein is a pivotal negative regulator of p53 [ 27 ] ; it interacts with the P53 protein masking its transcriptional domain and accelerating its proteasomal degradation [ 21 27 ] . The later process involves the deacetylation and ubiquitylation of the p53 protein by mdm2 [ 28 ] . Inactivation and/or degradation of p53 diminishes the cell ability to undergo apoptosis [ 21 ] . Conversely, p53 may influence mdm2." />
