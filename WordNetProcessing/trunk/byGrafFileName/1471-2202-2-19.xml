This tentative classification is based principally on the observation that agrin, in the absence of laminin, gives rise to structured receptor nanoaggregates, so that it seems in a sense to be a complete stimulus, while laminin-1 appears to take receptors only &lt;b&gt;part&lt;/b&gt; of the way toward mature and stabile receptor aggregates, based on structure and additional criteria already discussed." />
