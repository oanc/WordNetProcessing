Pro-apoptotic members, including Bax, Bak, Bid, and Bim, promote the release of death-inducing proteins, such as cytochrome c [ 2 3 ] , smac [ 4 ] , and endonuclease G [ 5 ] , from mitochondria while anti-apoptotic members, such as Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L , inhibit this release." />

While early defects in the electron transport chain can be reversed by addition of exogenous cytochrome c, the damage eventually becomes refractory to cytochrome c addition [ 8 ] . This finding suggests that pro-death Bcl-2 proteins can damage mitochondrial function independent of cytochrome c loss." />

The requirement for a specific cardiolipin structure that is likely defined by the contact site is consistent with our observation that no gold particles were found in regions stripped of the outer membrane exposing the cardiolipin-rich inner membrane." />
