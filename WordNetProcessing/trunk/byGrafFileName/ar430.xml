Soluble TNF-? receptor or neutralizing antibodies against TNF-? have been shown to prevent collagen-induced arthritis in mice [ 5 6 ] . Furthermore, a human TNF-? (hTNF-?) transgenic mouse (Tg197) develops a chronic, progressive polyarthritis with histologic features in common with RA [ 7 ] . Weight loss and joint swelling in these mice are correlated with expression of hTNF-? mRNA in the joints [ 7 ] and hTNF-? concentrations in the serum [ 8 9 ] . Previously, Keffer et al." />

Nevertheless, it is likely that much of the RA pathology involves TNF-? activation, and the results from the Tg197 model provide a sound scientific rationale for the therapeutic benefits observed following anti-TNF-? treatment in RA patients." />
