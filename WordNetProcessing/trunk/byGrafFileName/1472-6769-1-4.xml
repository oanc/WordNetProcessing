In addition, because the process of drug release is enzymatic, a single enzyme can generate a large amount of free drug." />

A cephalosporin-vinca alkaloid prodrug was 5-fold less toxic than the free drug against tumor cells in vitro, but was highly effective in tumor xenograft models in vivo [ 41 ] . When taxol was conjugated to a cephalosporin, the resulting prodrug was approximately 10-fold less toxic than free taxol against tumor cells in vitro [ 36 ] . Thus, prodrug 2 has the potential to be useful in cancer treatment using the ADEPT approach." />
