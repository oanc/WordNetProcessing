Accumulating lines of evidence indicates that PMA plays a complex role in regulation of cellular function, including PKC-dependent [ 18 19 20 ] and PKC-independent ways [ 23 24 21 ] . In the present results, PMA inhibited slow membrane depolarization and action potentials in response to glucose stimulation (Fig." />
