Further support for a potential role of the COX-2 pathway in lung cancer development comes from several investigations that demonstrated COX-2 overexpression in human lung tumors, specifically NSCLC [ 29 30 31 32 ] and precursor lesions [ 33 ] . While COX-2 expression was generally &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; to be increased in NSCLC and to a much lesser extent in SCLC, the role of COX-2 expression in latter tumor type is difficult to determine, due to the fact that the numbers of SCLC tumors examined in these studies was very small." />

A number of epidemiological studies have investigated the potential protective effect of NSAIDs with respect to other cancer sites." />
