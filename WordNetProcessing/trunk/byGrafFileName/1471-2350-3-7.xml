Initial indications of a genetic component were based on collections of case reports that suggested that IAs are associated with some rare simple Mendelian disorders, e.g. autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, Ehlers Danlos syndrome type IV and the Marfan syndrome [ 13 ] . More recent systematic prevalence estimates indicate either absence of association or markedly reduced prevalence of IA among patients with rare simple Mendelian disorders [ 14 15 ] . Also, genetic analyses of genes known to cause some simple Mendelian disorders have proven negative for collections of patients with IA [ 16 17 ] . The familial occurrence of IAs not associated with known simple Mendelian disorders was first noted in 1942 [ 18 ] and, since then, nearly one hundred case reports and review articles have been published." />
