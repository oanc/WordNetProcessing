These aberrantly spliced mRNAs, if translated, could lead to truncated receptors with hormone binding but not DNA binding function [ 44 ] . Further, there is evidence for the role of RNA processing in oncogenesis [ 45 46 ] . Many studies, including those on human hnRNP A2/B1 and the CD44 gene, suggest that high fidelity pre-mRNA splicing is critical to normal cellular function and may play a key role in oncogenesis and breast cancer progression [ 47 48 ] . The strong association between nmt55/p54 nrband hER? expression indicates that nmt55/p54 nrbmay be an important marker for breast cancer progression." />
