In patients with acute leukemia it has been reported that as many as two thirds of seropositive patients can develop reactivation of herpes simplex virus infection during remission induction therapy [ 26 ] . The risk of CMV infection in acute leukemia patients was recognized almost 30 years ago [ 27 ] but is of particular concern in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation [ 2 28 ] . EBV infection is frequently associated with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in T cell-depleted grafts [ 29 ] . As recently reported, HHV-6 can also be associated with bone marrow supression [ 30 ] , encephalitis and pneumonitis [ 7 8 ] after allogeneic transplantation." />
