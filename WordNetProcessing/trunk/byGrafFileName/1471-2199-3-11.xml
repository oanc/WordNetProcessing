Similarly, transfer of a wild type PTEN gene into anchorage-independent human glioblastoma cells (which lack functional PTEN), results in their greatly reduced ability to form colonies in soft agar [ 4 5 6 ] . The interpretation of these latter findings, however, is complicated by the strong anti-proliferative effects of PTEN even in monolayer culture, which is consistently observed when the wild type version of this gene is introduced into PTEN-negative tumor cells [ 4 6 7 8 9 10 18 33 ] . Moreover, in human glioma and breast cancer cell lines, the ectopic expression of wild type PTEN leads to anoikis, which is apoptosis initiated by the disruption of cell matrix-interactions [ 23 34 35 36 ] ." />

Furthermore, expression of the CDK inhibitor p27 Kip1was strongly increased in suspension cells (Figure 1), similar to what has been observed in other cell types after the disruption of cell-matrix interactions [ 29 31 32 ] . Finally, as we have reported before [ 31 ] , the expression of cdk4, one of the catalytic subunits of CDKs, was not significantly altered in suspension culture cells and therefore could be used as a loading control for the Western blot analysis." />

Furthermore, p27 Kip1is an established target of PTEN signaling, i.e., its activity has been found increased after the forced expression of exogenous PTEN [ 53 54 55 56 ] . In combination with the data presented in this manuscript, it therefore appears that PTEN contributes to anchorage-dependent growth control by a two-fold approach: the dephosphorylation of the signaling molecule FAK in combination with the stimulation of the cell cycle inhibitor p27 Kip1." />
