The American Cancer Society and the American Urologic Association recommend annual cancer screening with PSA testing and digital rectal examination for men with life expectancies greater than 10 years [ 5 6 ] . However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Physicians have not endorsed routine screening because there is no conclusive evidence that screening and treatment reduce morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer [ 7 8 ] . Another concern about prostate cancer screening is uncertainty about the diagnostic performance of PSA." />

Catalona and colleagues detected cancer in 22% of men biopsied with PSA levels between 2.6 to 4 ng/ml [ 37 ] and Lodding and colleagues detected cancers in 13% of men with PSA values between 3 to 4 ng/ml [ 39 ] . We found that lowering the cutpoint to 2 ng/ml, while greatly increasing sensitivity, led to an 80% false positive rate." />

The Gann study provided the least biased estimate of sensitivity and specificity, but even these results were limited because asymptomatic cancers would not have been detected [ 24 ] .
