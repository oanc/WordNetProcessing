Being positively charged and present in relatively low plasma concentrations, thiamine movement across cellular membranes requires transporters." />

The similar K m values found for cellular and mitochondrial uptake of thiamine for normal lymphoblasts and the lack of such uptake by TRMA mitochondria and TRMA cells suggests that high affinity thiamine import into mitochondria may be carried out by the same transporter or a variant form, perhaps generated by differential splicing, of that serving on the plasma membrane." />
