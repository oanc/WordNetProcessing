Using this approach, we have previously discovered specific associations between particular ?1 integrins and other cell surface molecules including CD147/EMMPRIN [ 31 ] , and various tetraspanin (transmembrane-4 superfamily) proteins [ 30 32 33 ] . In this report we demonstrate for the first time that CD98 constitutively and specifically associates with intact ?1 integrin heterodimers." />

Several important signaling molecules, including activated TCR, LAT and LCK are present in organized raft-type microdomains, and integrity of these microdomains is necessary for T cell receptor signal transduction [ 36 37 ] . Our present discovery that ?1 integrins specifically associate with CD98 in lipid microdomains helps to explain the functional connections between ?1 integrins and CD98 during T cell costimulation, monocyte fusion, and elsewhere." />
