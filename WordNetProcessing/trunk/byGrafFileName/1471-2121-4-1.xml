In particular, LPS is known to stimulate the macrophage secretion of nitric oxide [ 9 ] and inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) [ 10 ] . For this reason, we also determined if TNF-alpha or IL-1-beta were capable of enhancing the cytotoxic effects of CEES." />
