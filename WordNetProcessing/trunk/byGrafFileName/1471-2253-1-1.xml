In relation to mivacurium, cholinesterase activity level is a major determinant of the spontaneous recovery of mivacurium in pediatric population [ 8 22 ] . We did not quantify enzyme levels and therefore the inter-individual variations of spontaneous recovery times are difficult to be interpreted." />
