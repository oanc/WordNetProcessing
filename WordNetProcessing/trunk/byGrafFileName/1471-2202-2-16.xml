Our data show that PLD has a dual function in cholinergic cells, as the second product of its activity, choline, is used as a metabolic precursor of ACh, and suggest that this pathway may be regulated by the type of PLD isoform expressed in a particular class of cholinergic neurons." />

Given that prenatal choline supplementation improves memory and attention [ 34 ] , two cognitive functions that require the hippocampal cholinergic system, it is possible that the upregulated PLD pathway underlies, at least in &lt;b&gt;part&lt;/b&gt;, the cognitive enhancement observed in the prenatally choline-supplemented animals." />
