Close examination has revealed that some 'immature' hair cells form in Brn3c null mutants and express cellular markers such as Myosin VI and VIIa, calretinin and parvalbumin [ 3 ] . Furthermore, these immature hair cells of Brn3c null mutants undergo apoptosis in neonates [ 3 ] . Consistent with an apparent absence of mature hair cells, initial work suggested that all vestibular and most spiral ganglion cells are lost by postnatal day 14 (P14; [ 1 ] ). However, more detailed quantification by others [ 3 ] reported that at P4 about 77% of vestibular neurons and only 29% of spiral neurons are lost." />
