However, two dimensional gel electrophoresis analysis of the rDNA locus showed that replication initiated at all sites tested [ 11 ] . All six human homologs of yeast and Drosophila ORC subunits have been cloned and characterized [ 12 13 ] . Other replication proteins like Cdc6, Cdt1, MCMs, Cdc45 that are essential for initiation of DNA replication have also been reported [ 12 ] . Conservation of replication factors among higher eukaryotes suggests that functionally they may play similar roles." />
