Therefore, computational studies have been used extensively to study substrate binding, the role of the Zn(II) ions in catalysis, the protonation state of the active site, and inhibitor binding [ 37 42 55 56 57 58 59 ] . All of the substrate binding models have made assumptions before the substrate was docked into the active site [ 37 42 ] , and some of these assumptions have been shown to be invalid for certain substrates [ 43 ] . With L1, two key assumptions were made: (1) the bridging hydroxide functions as the nucleophile during catalysis and (2) Zn 1 coordinates the ?-lactam carbonyl [ 37 ] . With these assumptions and after energy minimizations, Ser224 was predicted to hydrogen bond to the substrate carboxylate [ 37 ] , reminiscent of the role predicted for Lys224 in CcrA [ 42 ] .
