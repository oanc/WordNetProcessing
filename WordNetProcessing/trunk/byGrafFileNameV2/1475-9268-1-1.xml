Aberrant segregation can also produce nullisomic aneuploids (missing one or more chromosomes), polysomic aneuploids (having additional copies of individual chromosomes), and diploids [ 38 39 44 ] . In S. pombe the haploids and diploids are viable, nullisomic aneuploids are inviable, and disomic aneuploids tend to &lt;b&gt;lose&lt;/b&gt; the extra chromosome or chromosomes and become haploid [ 45 ] . We therefore determined the frequencies of spore viability and meiotic diploidy as genetic measures of chromosome segregation errors." />
