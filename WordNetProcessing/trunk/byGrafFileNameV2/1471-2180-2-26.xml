Briefly, RNA and protein were extracted from parallel plates of podocytes using TRIZOL Reagent or RIPA buffer, respectively, under three conditions: 1) during sub-confluent growth at 33¡C; 2) immediately upon reaching confluency (day zero); and 3) on day 14 after switching confluent cultures to 37¡C." />

Kidney transplants between normal and transgenic Tg26 siblings suggested that specific HIV-1 proteins within the kidney, and not circulating factors, transform infected renal epithelium [ 13 ] . Indeed, HIV-1 transgenic mice generated with an HIV-1 proviral construct mutated in the Nef &quot;PXXP&quot; SH3-binding motif for Src-family kinases failed to develop nephropathy [ 31 ] , and a recent in vitro analysis of podocytes infected with single gene mutants of HIV-1 further suggest that Nef plays a central role in causing the proliferative phenotype in HIVAN [ 8 ] . Utilizing these same single gene mutant viruses, we showed here that Nef appears to be play a role in the up-regulation of cyclin D 1 by HIV-1 in vitro . Importantly, these single gene mutants do not exclude the possibility that other HIV-1 gene(s) may cooperate with nef to induce cyclin D1, particularly" />

In infected renal epithelium, HIV-1 could disrupt the inhibitory binding of pRb to E2F independent of endogenous cyclin D, analogous to transforming viral mechanisms that bypass and down-regulate endogenous cyclin D, such as SV-40 T antigen binding to pRb [ 16 ] , HHV-8 v -cyclin binding to and activating cyclin-dependent kinase-6 (CDK) [ 17 ] , and activation of cyclin E by EBV-induced c -myc [ 18 ] . Alternatively, HIV-1 could activate cyclin D-dependent proliferation, as exemplified by RSV v -src-mediated signaling [ 19 ] . In most tissues, the selective activation of these cell-cycle pathways is readily discernable." />

Figure 1depicts the intense, heterogeneous nuclear staining of glomerular podocytes and tubular epithelium from hyperplastic nephrons in the diseased transgenics versus the absent staining of nephrons in the non-transgenics consistent with the very low mitotic index in normal kidneys of adult animals [ 26 ] . This suggests that cyclin D 1 is promoting cell-cycle progression during the proliferation of epithelium in diseased kidneys." />
