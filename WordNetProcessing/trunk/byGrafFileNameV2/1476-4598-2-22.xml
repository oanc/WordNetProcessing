SLC/CCL21 recruits both na•ve lymphocytes and antigen stimulated DC into T cell zones of secondary lymphoid organs, co-localizing these early immune response constituents that culminate in cognate T cell activation [ 1 ] . The capacity to facilitate the co-localization of both DC and T cells forms a strong rationale for the use of SLC/CCL21 in cancer therapy." />
