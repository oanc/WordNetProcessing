Biophore #2 represents a flexible -CH 2 O- bridge between aryl moieties and was found to enhance the activity and selectivity of the inhibitors as &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; in the original &lt;b&gt;work&lt;/b&gt; [ 9 ] . Biophores #1 and #2 include aromatic moieties, whose main function is presumably to bind to the hydrophobic site of MAO." />
