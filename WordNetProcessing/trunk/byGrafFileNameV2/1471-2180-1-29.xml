Briefly, genomic DNA was isolated from the 25 Arg +strains, then digested with Sca I (which cuts neither CaCET1 nor UAU1 ). The digests were resolved by agarose gel-electrophoresis and &lt;b&gt;transferred&lt;/b&gt; to membranes, which were probed with a radiolabeled DNA corresponding to the 5' segment of CaCET1 (probe A in Figure 1)." />
