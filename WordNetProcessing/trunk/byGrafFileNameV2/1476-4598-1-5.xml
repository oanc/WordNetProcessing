Prostaglandin E-2 (PGE-2), constitutively produced by many NSCLC has been identified as one factor that has direct immunosuppressive properties and is &lt;b&gt;known&lt;/b&gt; to induce IL10 in mononuclear cells [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] . IL10 is a dominant immunosuppressive cytokine found in the NSCLC environment &lt;b&gt;known&lt;/b&gt; to directly affect T cell-mediated immunity [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 ] . Both PGE-2 and IL10 have been &lt;b&gt;shown&lt;/b&gt; to suppress antigen presentation, to suppress cytotoxic T cell (CTL) responses, and to inhibit cytokine production by T cells and antigen presenting cells, perhaps most importantly IL12, that plays a central role in initiation and potentiation of cellular immune responses [ 2 3 4 5 6 7 ] , [ 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 ] . We asked whether PGE-2 levels and/or IL10 levels were elevated in plasma of NSCLC patients, whether monocytes from NSCLC patients produce more IL10 than normals, and whether there was correlation within our findings." />
