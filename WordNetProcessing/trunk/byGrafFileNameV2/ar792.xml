As further evidence for the role of pro-inflammatory cytokines in RA, anti-tumor necrosis factor-? (anti-TNF-?) and anti-interleukin 1 (anti-IL-1) therapies can reduce inflammation and retard the progression of disease as assessed radiographically [ 15 16 ] . However, side-effects with these approaches, such as the development of lymphomas in patients using anti-TNF-? therapies, demonstrate that alternative therapies are needed [ 17 ] ." />

These enzymes have been implicated in the pathology of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA), and have long been therapeutic targets [ 12 ] .
