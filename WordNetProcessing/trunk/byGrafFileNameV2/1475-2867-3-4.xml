In the clinic, the expression of MHCII on colorectal carcinomas is correlated with more favourable prognosis [ 6 ] . Adoptive &lt;b&gt;transfer&lt;/b&gt; studies show that ex vivo activated CD4+ T cells are able to recognize, and to eliminate, MHCII-positive tumors either by themselves [ 7 ] or in co-operation with CD8+ T cells [ 8 ] . It has been also demonstrated that the increased MHCII expression on tumor cells and macrophages following treatment with IFNg in vivo was associated with enhanced efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy in a mouse model of metastatic sarcoma [ 9 ] ." />
