The conservation of the zinc fingers from invertebrate to vertebrate species and their common DNA binding target sequences suggest that these proteins may play similar physiological roles in diverse organisms." />

Similarly, expression of transcription factors, in conjunction with the recombination activating genes, has been shown to induce V(D)J recombination in non-lymphoid tissues by rendering RSS accessible to the recombinase [ 61 ] . The ?B motif, first found in the Ig? light chain [ 62 ] , and later in the TCR ?2 locus [ 31 ] , has been shown to promote V(D)J recombination by modulating locus accessibility [ 63 ] . In addition to influencing recombination by binding of RSS, KRC binding of the ?B motif may modulate accessibility and transcription of target loci." />
