Because chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1? and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) are expressed in RA synovial tissue [ 7 8 ] , subsets of CD8 +T cells may be preferentially recruited into the synovial tissue in a non-antigen-specific manner." />
