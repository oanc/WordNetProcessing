The American Cancer Society and the American Urologic Association recommend annual cancer screening with PSA testing and digital rectal examination for men with life expectancies greater than 10 years [ 5 6 ] . However, the United States Preventive Services Task Force and the American College of Physicians have not endorsed routine screening because there is no conclusive evidence that screening and treatment reduce morbidity and mortality from prostate cancer [ 7 8 ] . Another concern about prostate cancer screening is uncertainty about the diagnostic performance of PSA." />

Catalona and colleagues detected cancer in 22% of men biopsied with PSA levels between 2.6 to 4 ng/ml [ 37 ] and Lodding and colleagues detected cancers in 13% of men with PSA values between 3 to 4 ng/ml [ 39 ] .
