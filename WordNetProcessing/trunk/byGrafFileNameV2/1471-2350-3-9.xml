These observations are consistent with and extend the findings of 21 previously reported case-controlled studies from thirteen countries which demonstrate the significantly increased prevalence of A*03 in persons with hemochromatosis [ 16 ] . The alleles B*07 and B*14 were also more common in the present Alabama probands and in Alabama probands diagnosed before discovery of HFE than in corresponding control subjects [ 21 ] . The present analysis demonstrates that this is attributable largely to the association of B*07 and B*14 with A*03, consistent with observations in persons with hemochromatosis patients from many locations, including Ireland [ 6 ] , Brittany [ 2 32 33 34 ] , Denmark [ 7 8 ] , Sweden [ 9 35 36 ] , Germany [ 10 11 37 38 ] , Portugal [ 30 39 ] , Italy [ 2 40 ] , and Utah [ 20 ] ." />
