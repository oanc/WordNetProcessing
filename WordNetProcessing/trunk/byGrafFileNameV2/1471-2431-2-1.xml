The risk of CMV infection in acute leukemia patients was recognized almost 30 years ago [ 27 ] but is of particular concern in patients undergoing allogeneic transplantation [ 2 28 ] . EBV infection is frequently associated with post-transplantation lymphoproliferative disorders in T cell-depleted grafts [ 29 ] .
