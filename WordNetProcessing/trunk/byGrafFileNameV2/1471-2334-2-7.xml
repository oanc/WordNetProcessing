Furthermore, HSV-2 clinical isolates were shown to have a higher frequency of spontaneous mutations resistant to ACV and PCV, approximately 30-fold, compared to HSV-1 isolates, and the majority of these mutations are in tk . Consistent with this observation, HSV-2 strains also exhibited approximately a 20- to 80-fold higher spontaneous mutation rate to cidofovir (HPMPC), an inhibitor of HSV Pol, resistance compared with HSV-1 [ 21 ] . Therefore, these naturally-occuring mutations are not unique to tk and TK substrates as detected with antiviral agents ACV and PCV, but were extended with the direct Pol inhibitor, HPMPC, to other loci, most likely pol ." />
