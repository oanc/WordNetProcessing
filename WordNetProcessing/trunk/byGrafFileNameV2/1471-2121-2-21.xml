Quantitatively, gonadotrope responsiveness is more important than the level of GnRH secretion; for example, during the estrogen-stimulated preovulatory surge of LH secretion in the rat there is a 5-fold increase in GnRH secretion but a 50-fold increase in LH secretion [ 7 ] . Moreover, a quantity of GnRH that will evoke a normal preovulatory LH surge during the period preceding ovulation will induce only a small increase in LH secretion at other stages of the estrous cycle [ 7 ] . Similarly, termination of the preovulatory LH surge appears to be due to desensitization of the gonadotrope to GnRH action; in the sheep, a decrease in LH secretion precedes the decrease in GnRH secretion [ 41 ] , whereas in the rat, although the decrease in GnRH and LH secretion are co-incident [ 7 ] , there is evidence that the gonadotrope is already desensitized to GnRH [ 42 43 ] ." />
