ESTs AI560960 and AI369608 were identical and contained YL-1 exons 1 and 2 but splice within exon 2 at position 276 (position is in bp relative to Genbank sequence D43642) to position 1107 (internal to exon 6) (Fig." />

Whereas tropomodulins or the Arp 2/3 complex cap the pointed end of actin filaments, the barbed end can be capped by CapZ, ?, ?, and ? adducins as well as gelsolin [ 9 10 11 ] . Control of thin filament length is critical for maintaining proper sarcomere function and length [ 12 ] . Inhibition of Tmod1's capping activity - either by using an antibody to its C-terminal end or by decreasing expression using an antisense Tmod1 transcript - results in elongated thin filaments and decreased cardiac contractility [ 13 14 ] . Tmod1 overexpression in rat cardiomyocytes causes shortening of the thin filaments and sarcomere disorganization, resulting in myofibril degeneration [ 14 ] . Likewise, mice overexpressing TMOD1 in the heart show disrupted sarcomere organization with shortened thin filaments, leading to myofibril degeneration and dilated cardiomyopathy [ 15 ] . Recently, Littlefield and colleagues showed that overexpression of GFP-Tmod1 in chick cardiac myocytes results in shortening of thin filaments; the authors proposed that excess Tmod1 decreases the affinity between actin monomers and pointed ends, leading to monomer dissociation and filament shortening [ 42 ] . Mutations in many proteins making up the cardiac sarcomere have been shown to cause cardiac hypertrophy [ 16 17 18 19 ] :mutations in the TPM1 gene, for example, cause type 3 familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (CMH3), and a transgenic mouse expressing a CMH3 mutation develops ventricular myocyte disarray and hypertrophy [ 20 ] . Mutations in myosin heavy chain 7 are estimated to account for 40-50% of the cases of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [ 21 ] ." />
