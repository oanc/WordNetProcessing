The next destination was discussed: once again the Secret Service recommended against returning to Washington, and the Vice President agreed.
By September 14, Vice President Cheney had decided to recommend, at least as a first step, a new White House entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department.
This book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries, public and private, large and small, general and specialized.
Such therapy appears to be cost effective [ 15 16 ] , especially among high risk patients and is recommended under current American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines [ 17 ] . Fourth, it may not be possible to ascertain whether these findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels.
Even if these findings are not confirmed after further study, one could still make a compelling argument that lipid-lowering therapy (barring contraindications) should be initiated early and universally in patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome: First, the long-term safety and effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is well-established [ 1 2 3 ] ; Second, as evidenced by MIRACL, these agents are safe when initiated at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome; Third, the in-hospital initiation of lipid-lowering therapy appears to promote greater long-term utilization of these agents [ 18 19 20 21 ] . Finally, although lipid levels may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (excepting total :HDL and LDL:HDL cholesterol ratios [ 22 ] ) the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic lipid-lowering interventions to attain recommended cholesterol targets [ 23 24 25 ] ; newer guidelines are even more stringent [ 26 ] . Furthermore, data from the recently presented Heart Protection Study suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of baseline cholesterol level [ 4 ] . Thus, to withhold lipid-lowering therapy from patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo, and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal [ 27 28 ] .
California's supply base currently has a 6% capacity margin, well below the average 15-20%, which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the West.

Therefore, the National Energy Plan recommended that the Administration's approach include appropriate measures to address local concerns, such as the unlikely occurrence of an SO2 "hot spot" or area of concentrated emissions.
Insofar as the work of the ISO 12083 Math Committee stopped short of recommending ways to handle "semantic" aspects of math markup, recognizing that the issues were many and difficult, the work of this committee in that regard feels to me a welcome addition to the overall discussion of those sorts of problems.
Section 3623(a) directs the Postal Service to file a request with the Postal Rate Commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the Reorganization Act's effective date.
The Postal Service complied with this requirement early in 1973, and a Domestic Mail Classification Schedule recommended by the Commission became effective on July 6, 1976.
The Postal Service's innovative Mailing Online service, for which a three-year experimental trial was requested and approved in Docket No. MC2000-2, was initially considered and recommended by the Commission under the market test rules.
17 More recently, in Docket No. MC2001-1, the Commission recommended three new worksharing-based discounted Priority Mail categories after negotiating with mailers who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could reduce the Postal Service's costs.
Examples of "niche classification" proposals recommended in recent Commission proceedings, and Postal Service product innovations considered in other cases, are described in the Appendix to this report.

It is expected that FASAB will continue to recommend statements on specialized topics.
Studies suggest that a wide gap exists between the 2 minutes clinicians typically allot to seeking evidence [ 2 ] and the amount of time needed to search MEDLINE [ 4 12 13 ] . Indeed, "some have likened MEDLINE searching to attempting to drink water from a fire hose" [ 15 ] . Although MEDLINE is certainly more difficult to search than other resources recommended for evidence-based medicine, the other resources, in aggregate, probably require excessive time to search if they are searched in sequence as recommended.
First, there is no difference between a portfolio manager who recommends stocks in an interview to a reporter--which is the meat and potatoes of financial journalism--and a portfolio manager who recommends stocks in a column of his own--which is considered controversial--except that the second portfolio manager reveals his holdings while the first one doesn't have to.
Probes were printed on 3D-link slides, followed by coupling and processing as recommended by the manufacturer (SurModics, Eden Prairie, MN).
3. Where state regulations prohibit importation of non-native fishes or use of the recommended test species, permission must be requested from the appropriate state agency prior to their use.

Unless the samples are used in an on-site toxicity test the day of collection (or hand delivered to the testing laboratory for use on the day of collection), it is recommended that they be held at 0-6Â°C until used to inhibit microbial degradation, chemical transformations, and loss of highly volatile toxic substances.
Even without the changes we recommend, the American public has vested enormous authority in the U.S. government.
It is almost inevitable during the construction phase that scope of work changes by the owner, errors and omissions in the plans, unknown or changed site conditions, and creative initiatives on the part of construction staff will result in recommended changes to the facility design.
Further work is needed to help physicians to understand their patients' views on hepatitis C. A recent study showed that persons with hepatitis C preferred to expedite periods of poor health, implying that they may be more likely to proceed with antiviral therapy and its attendant side effects than to delay treatment [ 19 ] . In contrast, the physicians in the current survey had a relatively high threshold for recommending treatment, which would lead them to postpone therapy in the majority of cases.
2 are the recommended acute toxicity test organisms.
It is recommended that total alkalinity and total hardness also be measured in the undiluted effluent test water and the dilution water.
Another option that has been suggested is differential payment scales depending on whether or not a technology such as computerized physician order entry is in use or not, which has been recommended by the Medicare Patient Advisory Commission [ 49 ] . Examples of the type of financial incentives already in play that could provide good starts include legislation already under consideration by Congress.
For this reason, it is recommended that only approximately 10% of the test organisms be exposed initially to the dilution water.
If the Commission believed that a low markup for the subclasses was in order, then the low markup could be recommended.

Reinforcing the idea is the first candidate--Washington Bullet Gheorghe Muresan, who, besides being the NBA's tallest player ever, is known as one of its least articulate: The Bullets use him in an ad whose entire point is that he can't even manage to recommend that viewers buy tickets to a Bullets game.
We recommend that this type of missing data also be coded as 'No'.
To ensure that contracts support a knowledge-based process, we further recommend that DOD structure its contracts for major weapon system acquisitions so that (a) the capture and use of knowledge described in recommendation one for beginning system demonstration is a basis for DOD's decision to invest in the manufacturing capability to build initial prototypes and (b) the capture and use of manufacturing and reliability knowledge discussed in recommendation one for moving from system

) The book, they say, is a witty sendup of therapeutic literature, and it also serves as a "seriously legitimate guide for the perplexed" (Benito Rakower, the Washington Post ). Critics also recommend it as a sort of highbrow Cliff's Notes : "You don't need to have read Proust in order to read this book; in fact, once you've read de Botton you don't need to read it at all" (Richard Klein, Voice Literary Supplement ).
The focus of the study will be to determine what changes need to be made in the existing structure to allow the Center to effectively meet its mission or, alternatively, to recommend a new structure.

TIMOTHY: To be honest, a lot of the films recommended by the critics make me feel more like a voyeur than a spectator --
Although we go into this matter more thoroughly in the companion paper, we reiterate here that this subjective use of the autocorrelation function to establish rhythmicity is not unprecedented; in fact, it has been recommended as a valid approach to situations like our experiments where the number of data points is relatively small [ 30 ] . In general, it must be noted that the use of both tabulated and averaged data also supports this approach.
