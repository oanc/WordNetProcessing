So this was the first time that you saw the statement that was going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class.
And so she hasn't heard this one-minute statement be read in the class yet?
The statement that the school district developed to be read as part of the biology class, is it your understanding that the statement that was drafted in January, 2005, or for use in January, 2005, was modified in June of 2005?
And can you tell us who submitted -- whose response did you read in the paper?
And what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper, Mrs. Eveland?
"The first board meeting I attended in July he approached me before the meeting started and asked if I had read the -- if I was familiar with the comments that were quoted in the paper.
Ma'am, do you understand that the statement that's going to be read to the students in the ninth-grade biology class was modified in June of 2005?
Who can, for instance, blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he reads in Pater's Marius The Epicurean (Chapter V) a reference to Apuleius' The Golden Ass noting that “all through the book, there is an unmistakably real feeling for asses ...”
I have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of Australia in the 1870s and I have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse.

Reactions were incubated at 60°C for 1 hour in an I-Cycler (BioRad, Hercules, CA) reading both FAM and Cy3 channels.
In C. elegans , two genes each encode unusual bifunctional enzymes containing both isocitrate lyase and malate synthase domains [ 49 ] . Since the isocitrate lyase domain lies within the amino-terminal half of the C. elegans bifunctional enzyme and none of the Meloidogyne EST reads stretches across both domains, further sequencing of the 3' end of cDNA clones from the M. hapla or M. javanica isocitrate lyase ESTs will be necessary to determine whether the Meloidogyne genus contains a bifunctional glyoxylate enzyme homolog similar to that of
Third, by in-house sequencing of 44 gene coding variations found in the in silico alignments of three genes from B6, D2, A/J, 129X1/SvJ, and 129S1/SvImJ DNA, we verified that Celera had not mislabeled the strain from which sequence reads were derived and showed that no mix-up or cross-contamination of samples had occurred.
When in-house sequencing was done to fill gaps from the in silico alignment, a minimum of one forward read and one reverse <b>read</b> was run for each sample of PCR products.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
Aliquots of 20 μl of each lysate were transferred to flat-bottomed, white microtiter plates (Dynex, Chantilly, VA, USA) and read on a Dynex MLX plate reader in flash mode.
To estimate the number of 5' versus 3' reads, we examined the 4,198 ESTs with detectable homology on either sense or antisense strands at time of submission (BLASTX search versus the SWIR non-redundant protein database, Sanger Centre).
In this manner, the entire coding region and all splice junctions of Tlr4 could be covered with a total of 14 sequencing reads.
Several security managers said that short policies that emphasized the most important aspects of the organizations security concerns were more likely to be read and understood than voluminous and detailed policies.
Mothers who failed to read a sentence out loud in Spanish (from daily life) were classified as illiterate (25/493).

Independent assembly of each sample was required as a condition for further analysis, and if such assembly failed, additional reads were executed using a secondary collection of primers.

Both authors read and approved the final manuscript.
Word counting is less prone to these sources of error, and uses information intrinsic to biases in codon usage by counting codon pairs as hexamers in a sliding window, whereas codons are <b>read</b> in non-overlapping, tiled <b>windows</b>.
We therefore redefined the outcome measure to be read simply as positive (+) or negative (-).
Samples and standards were placed in a microtiter plate and read on the CytoFluor reader from Applied Biosystems (Foster City, CA) (excitation 485 nm/20 nm and emission 530 nm/25 nm).
Aliquots of 20 μl of each lysate were transferred to flat-bottomed, white microtiter plates (Dynex, Chantilly, VA, USA) and read on a Dynex MLX plate reader in flash mode.

3 IRS' new mission statement reads, "Provide America's taxpayers top quality service by helping them understand and <b>meet</b> their tax responsibilities and by applying the tax law with integrity and fairness to all."
All authors read and approved the final manuscript.
And finally, the Celera SNP database does not indicate which regions of a gene's coding sequence are covered by reads in each strain, and therefore does not distinguish between completely sequenced regions in which no variants have been detected and regions where no variants are found because sequence coverage for one of the strains is absent.
All authors read and approved the final manuscript
And because it doesn't need to be held open, you can read the Rocket one-handed.
Rather, they read the language to narrow it, to confine it to historical circumstances, in effect, to defeat the vision of a new, more just society.
Do you like to read to them?
So when you read to yourself did you <b>read</b> different stories than the ones they would <b>read</b> to you?
Can she read to herself yet?
Can you think of a story that they told you that you liked for them to read over and over?
